This program detects plagiarism between two text documents using cosine similarity. This is done by turning the raw text data into vectors of numbers, then comparing the vectors to compute the similarity between the two.

Upon running the program, the user will see three lines stating the similarity score between indoors1.txt, outdoors1.txt, and outdoors2.txt. To test more similarity scores, one simply needs to add more .txt files to the same folder as app.py. The program automatically compares all .txt files to each other.

To run: python3 main.py

This program requires a Python IDE of some kind to run. It has been tested with Visual Studio Code.
